## INTRODUCTION ##
This is a Keras implementation of image steganography via deep learning, which is similar to the work in paper ["Hiding Images in Plain Sight: Deep Steganography "](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6802-hiding-images-in-plain-sight-deep-steganography)

Steganography is the science of unobtrusively concealing a secret message within some cover data. In this case, a full-sized color image is hidden inside another image with minimal changes in appearance utilizing deep convolutional neural networks.
